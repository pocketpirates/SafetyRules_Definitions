const FOREWORD = `FOREWORD
Rivenhall IWMF Safety Rules are provided to ensure that work can be undertaken without hazard from Electrical or Mechanical Equipment. 
The Safety Rules are mandatory for work at Rivenhall IWMF. It is the duty of every person who may be concerned with work on the system to make themselves thoroughly familiar with the Safety Rules and supporting documents appropriate to the activity that they are undertaking. In addition, all persons have a general duty to be conversant with and to observe statutory requirements relating to any activities to which they have an involvement.
Work should never be considered to be so urgent or important that time cannot be taken to plan it properly and perform it safely. 
The issue of a safety document does not, in itself, make a job safe. The achievement of safety from all inherent dangers also depends on full and logical preparation of work. This includes: - 
• Identifying and assessing all reasonably foreseeable risks thereby implementing control measures to reduce the significant risks to a level, which as a minimum satisfies all current legislative requirements and even more importantly is acceptable to persons performing the task. 
• Executing the work in a safe manner by suitably competent personnel. 
The risk assessment for the task identifies the risks associated with carrying out the work and also the risks inherent in the system in its operational state. These rules, associated procedures and instructions therefore define the control measures necessary to reduce these system risks to an acceptable level.
If, whether intentionally or through neglect or carelessness, a person fails to observe the Safety Rules and supporting documents, or unnecessarily endangers the personal safety of either themselves or others, then, in the case of an employee, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action under the Company’s Disciplinary Policy or, in any other case, that person will be subject to such action as the Company may consider appropriate in the circumstances. 
POLICY, PHILOSOPHY AND PRINCIPLES 
Policy 
It is Rivenhall IWMF, QESH and TC Policy that a health and safety management system is in place, which regards the application of legal requirements as the minimum level of achievement. 
The health and safety management system specifically includes these Safety Rules, and is supported by Company Procedures and Guidance Documents, which establish the strategy for the control of health and safety.




Page 1

All personnel shall observe their personal responsibilities and co-operate in ensuring that Indaver/Rivenhall IWMF meet their legal duties. 
Philosophy
Items of Plant and/or Apparatus may be interconnected to form a process System and can contain inherent dangers. This System is to be designed so that when in its normal operating mode it may be operated without Danger, if safe working procedures are correctly applied. 
When work other than operation has to be carried out affecting the Plant and/or Apparatus, which is a departure from the normal operating mode or working procedures, it is necessary to specify rules to achieve safety from the inherent Dangers. 
Safety Rules supported by Company Procedures and Guidance Documents clearly specify the Safe System of Work (SSoW) that shall be implemented. This is to establish the conditions in which persons, who have to carry out work on the Plant and/or Apparatus, shall be safeguarded from the inherent dangers contained in the System. Additional SSoW’s shall be established to reduce the risks from hazards that exist outside of the System.
Principles
The Safety Rules are concerned with achieving and maintaining safety of persons and are based on the following principles: - 
A Safe System of Work shall be established prior to the commencement of work on Plant and/or Apparatus. The work carried out shall be safe from the System. 
• When the work is carried out on Plant and/or Apparatus, the primary means of achieving safety is by controlled isolation from the System and the control of stored energy. No work shall be carried out on or near Live Apparatus unless it is unreasonable for it to be dead and it is reasonable for a person to be working while it is Live and that suitable precautions are taken to prevent injury. 
• Persons engaged in work activities associated with these Safety Rules shall be assessed as having the technical knowledge and experience necessary to prevent Danger or injury, having regard to the nature of the work. The nomination of a person to carry out a defined role shall be authorised in writing by the Plant Manager who has responsibility for the Location, or his nominee. 
The above principles involve: - 
• The co-ordination of activities, which include the provision of instruction, information and training on the application of precautions. This will involve the confirmation of the administration of the safety rules documentation necessary for conducting the work. 
• The safe removal from service and restoration of Plant and/or Apparatus, which includes taking action to ensure the Plant and/or Apparatus, is in a safe condition for its intended purpose.
 • The performing of work in accordance with established procedures and precautions, with the proper application of the necessary documentation.

PART A - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
1. INTERPRETATION 
1.1. SHALL 
When “shall” is used in these Safety Rules or associated procedures with no qualification, this indicates a mandatory requirement with no discretion permitted and no judgement to be made. 
1.2. SHALL, WHERE PRACTICABLE 
When “shall, where practicable” is used to qualify a requirement, a slightly less strict standard is imposed. It means that where it is possible to achieve in the light of current knowledge and invention, bearing in mind the hazards associated with work to be undertaken, then the requirement shall be met. One is not allowed to avoid the requirement on the grounds of difficulty, inconvenience or cost. 
1.3. SHALL, WHERE REASONABLY PRACTICABLE 
When “shall, where reasonably practicable” is used to qualify a requirement then a judgement must be made as to what is reasonable, taking into account the magnitude of the risk on the one hand and the cost, time and trouble, or effort necessary for averting the risk on the other hand. 
1.4. WORK 
When used in these Safety Rules, the term “work” may include testing.

 2. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
2.1. All persons with responsibilities under these Safety Rules must possess sufficient knowledge and/or experience to avoid Danger. They must have received training for the roles that they are to perform under the Safety Rules. 
2.2. Any person receiving instructions in the application of these Safety Rules shall report to the person giving those instructions any objections on safety grounds to carrying them out. Any such objections shall be dealt with in accordance with an Approved written procedure. 
2.3. If a hazard arises or is suspected during the course of work, which could give rise to Danger, the work shall cease, the situation shall be reported immediately to the Safety Controller and all persons withdrawn from the Plant and/or Apparatus concerned. 
2.4. In addition to these Safety Rules, other associated policies, procedures and instructions issued by Rivenhall IWMF, or other authorities shall be complied with. 
3. GENERAL SAFETY 
3.1. In addition to the requirements for establishing Safety from the System specified in these rules, General Safety must be established and maintained at all times at and in the vicinity of the place of work. Supervisors must ensure that General Safety is established, monitored and maintained. During the course of the work members of the Working Party must maintain General Safety and ensure other work areas are not adversely affected by their activities.
Page 5 

3.2. The discharging of responsibility for General Safety will be achieved as part of the normal pattern of management delegation and control by ensuring that all activities are in accordance with appropriate instructions &amp; guidance. 
3.3. When a requirement for work is identified, it is fundamental that prior to work commencing the hazards present shall be recognised, the risks assessed and the necessary control measures implemented to reduce any risk to an acceptable level. 

4. EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
4.1. Work on Plant and/or Apparatus, which is part of the System and to which these Safety Rules cannot be applied, or for specific, exceptional circumstances should not be applied, shall be carried out in accordance with an Approved written procedure. 

PART B - THE BASIC SAFETY RULES 
1. APPLICATION OF THE RULES 
1.1. These Safety Rules shall be applied to all Plant and Apparatus, which form part of the System. 
1.2. Any Plant and/or Apparatus not considered to be part of the System, to which these Safety Rules therefore do not apply, shall be identified in an Approved written procedure and an alternative safe system of work shall be provided. 
1.3. Plant and Apparatus shall be added to and removed from the System only in accordance with an Approved written procedure, which shall determine the time when these Safety Rules are to be applied to new equipment and cease to apply to equipment removed. The Approved written procedure may include provision for equipment temporarily disconnected and removed from the normal service position to workshops or work area to be considered as temporarily removed from the System. 

2. APPROACH TO EXPOSED HIGH VOLTAGE CONDUCTORS AND /OR INSULATORS 
2.1. Persons shall not allow any part of their body to approach exposed conductors designed for, and operated at, High Voltage, or insulators supporting such conductors, within the Safety Distances specified in 2.4, unless the conductors have been Isolated and Danger has been excluded. 
2.2. When exposed High Voltage conductors are not Isolated, the only objects permitted to approach them, or insulators supporting them, within the Safety Distances specified in 2.4, shall be Approved insulated devices. 
2.3. When exposed conductors are Isolated but could be subject to High Voltage, the only objects, which shall be caused to approach them, or insulators supporting them, within the Safety Distances specified in 2.4, shall be Approved voltage measuring devices or Earthing Devices.
